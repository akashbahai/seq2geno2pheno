# Seq2Geno2Pheno

### What is Seq2Geno2Pheno?
This is a computational framework for genomic studies of bacterial population. Compared to conventional methods, such as shell scripts, this package emphasizes data reproducibility and computational environment management. 

### What can Seq2Geno2Pheno do?
Seq2Geno2Pheno includes two main stages. The first stage Seq2Geno aims to compute genomic features with sequencing reads. Briefly speaking, it covers (1) variant calling, (2) expression analysis, (3) _de novo_ assembly and gene content identification, and (4) phylogeny inference. These are followed by optional functionals of (5) differential expression analysis and (6) ancestral reconstruction. 
The outputs from Seq2Geno are formatted for the subsequent stage: Geno2Pheno. This stage mainly trains phenotype predictors with the genomic data. Furthermore, it reports lists of genomic factors that are potentially linked to the target phenotype using feature selection techniques.

### Get started
- Prerequisites

    - conda (tested version: 4.6.14)
    - python (tested verson: 3.6)
    - Linux (tested version: Debian GNU/Linux 8.8 jessie)
    - git (tested version: 2.18)

- Installation of Seq2Geno2Pheno

__to be added__

### Usage and Input

```
usage: sgp [-h] [-v] -f CONFIG_F

Seq2Geno2Pheno: the pipline tool for genomic features computation and phenotype predictor training

optional arguments:
  -h, --help
    show this help message and exit
  -v
    show program's version number and exit
  -f CONFIG_F
    the yaml file where the arguments are listed
```

Example:
```
  seq2geno2pheno -f options.yml
```

The only input file (i.e. `options.yml`) is a yaml file where all options are described. The file consists of five main parts:

1. config_f: the input filename itself

2. review_args: boolean value to specify if the software exits after only displaying the arguments

3. functions: the target computational processes

| option | action | values ([default])|
| --- | --- | --- |
| dryrun | display the processes and exit | [Y]/N |
| s | identify variants (SNPs) | Y/[N] |
| d | create _de novo_ assemblies and analyze gene contents | Y/[N] |
| e | count expression levels | Y/[N] |
| p | infer the phylogeny | Y/[N] |
| de | conduct analysis of differential expression | Y/[N] |
| ar | ancestrally reconstruct the expression levels | Y/[N] |

4. files: materials for the process specified in _functions_ session

    - cores: available number of CPUs 
    Although the parameter is included in the "files" session, please just set a number instead of specifying a file where the number is stated.

    - wd: the working directory
    The intermediate and final files will be created under the folder. The final outcomes will be symlinked to RESULTS/.

    - DNA-reads: The list of DNA-seq data 

    It should be a two-column list, where the first column includes all samples and the second column lists the __paired-end reads files__. The two reads file are separated by a comma. The first line is the first sample.
    ```
    sample01	sample01_1.fastq.gz,sample01_2.fastq.gz
    sample02	sample02_1.fastq.gz,sample02_2.fastq.gz
    sample03	sample03_1.fastq.gz,sample03_2.fastq.gz
    ```

    - RNA-reads: The list of RNA-seq data

    It should be a two-column list, where the first column includes all samples and the second column lists the __short reads files__. The first line is the first sample.
    ```
    sample01	sample01.rna.fastq.gz
    sample02	sample02.rna.fastq.gz
    sample03	sample03.rna.fastq.gz
    ```

    - pheno: The phenotype table

    For n samples with m phenotypes, the table is n-by-m and the upper-left is blank. The table is tab-separated. The header line includes the name of phenotypes. Missing values are allowed.
    ```
	    virulence
    sample01	high
    sample02	mediate
    sample03	low
    ```

    - ref-fa, ref-gff, ref-gbk	The reference data

    The fasta, gff, and genbank files of a reference genome. They should have the same sequence ids. 

    - adaptor: The adaptor file (optional)

    The fasta file of adaptors of DNA-seq. It is used to process the DNA-seq reads. 

5. prediction: the details about machine learning

    - pred: the name of machine learning project

    - models: the machine learning algorithm
    Possible algorithms include __[]__. (please refer to __[sklearn page]__)

    - part: the method to partition samples
    The dataset will be divided for testing predictor performance. Possible methods include __[a table to briefly expalin]__.

    - fold_n: the number of fold for cross-validation
    The value should be a positive integer. Common values are 5 and 10, and our default is __[]__.

    - optimize: the target metric to optimize
    Possible values include __[]__. (please refer to __[sklearn page]__)

    - test_perc: the percentage of samples 
    It specifies the amount of sample that will be isolated from the whole set for independent testing. These samples will not be used to train the predictor but only evaluate the performance. 
    The values should fall between 0.0 and 1.0, and the default is __[]__.

    - k-mer: the k-mer size for encoding genome sequences
    The value should be an integer, and the default is __[]__.

    - cls: classification labels
    The file specifies classification labels based on the phenotypes. It is a two-column tab-separated file, where the first column is the phenotypes and the second column includes their prediction labels. 
    ```
    high	class_1
    mediate	class_1
    low	class_2
    ```

    - out: the prediction output folder
